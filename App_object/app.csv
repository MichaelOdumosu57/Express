Property,Type,Description,Default
case sensitive routing,Boolean,"Enable case sensitivity. When enabled ""/Foo"" and ""/foo"" are different routes. When disabled ""/Foo"" and ""/foo"" are treated the same. NOTE: Sub-apps will inherit the value of this setting.",N/A (undefined)
env,String,"Environment mode. Be sure to set to ""production"" in a production environment; see Production best practices: performance and reliability.",process.env.NODE_ENV (NODE_ENV environment variable) or “development” if NODE_ENV is not set.
etag,Varied,Set the ETag response header. For possible values see the etag options table. More about the HTTP ETag header.,weak
jsonp callback name,String,Specifies the default JSONP callback name.,“callback”
json escape,Boolean,Enable escaping JSON responses from the res.json res.jsonp and res.send APIs. This will escape the characters < > and & as Unicode escape sequences in JSON. The purpose of this it to assist with mitigating certain types of persistent XSS attacks when clients sniff responses for HTML. NOTE: Sub-apps will inherit the value of this setting.,N/A (undefined)
json replacer,Varied,The replacer argument used by `JSON.stringify`. NOTE: Sub-apps will inherit the value of this setting.,N/A (undefined)
json spaces,Varied,The space argument used by `JSON.stringify`. This is typically set to the number of spaces to use to indent prettified JSON. NOTE: Sub-apps will inherit the value of this setting.,N/A (undefined)
query parser,Varied,Disable query parsing by setting the value to false or set the query parser to use either “simple” or “extended” or a custom query string parsing function. The simple query parser is based on Node’s native query parser querystring. The extended query parser is based on qs. A custom query string parsing function will receive the complete query string and must return an object of query keys and their values.,"""extended"""
strict routing,Boolean,"Enable strict routing. When enabled the router treats ""/foo"" and ""/foo/"" as different. Otherwise the router treats ""/foo"" and ""/foo/"" as the same. NOTE: Sub-apps will inherit the value of this setting.",N/A (undefined)
subdomain offset,Number,The number of dot-separated parts of the host to remove to access subdomain.,2
trust proxy,Varied,Indicates the app is behind a front-facing proxy and to use the X-Forwarded-* headers to determine the connection and the IP address of the client. NOTE: X-Forwarded-* headers are easily spoofed and the detected IP addresses are unreliable. When enabled Express attempts to determine the IP address of the client connected through the front-facing proxy or series of proxies. The `req.ips` property then contains an array of IP addresses the client is connected through. To enable it use the values described in the trust proxy options table. The `trust proxy` setting is implemented using the proxy-addr package. For more information see its documentation. NOTE: Sub-apps will inherit the value of this setting even though it has a default value.,false (disabled)
views,String or Array,A directory or an array of directories for the applications views. If an array the views are looked up in the order they occur in the array.,process.cwd() + /views
view cache,Boolean,"Enables view template compilation caching. NOTE: Sub-apps will not inherit the value of this setting in production (when `NODE_ENV` is ""production"").",true in production otherwise undefined.
view engine,String,The default engine extension to use when omitted. NOTE: Sub-apps will inherit the value of this setting.,N/A (undefined)
x-powered-by,Boolean,"Enables the ""X-Powered-By: Express"" HTTP header.",true
Type,Value
Boolean,If true the client’s IP address is understood as the left-most entry in the X-Forwarded-* header. If false the app is understood as directly facing the Internet and the client’s IP address is derived from req.connection.remoteAddress. This is the default setting.
"String
String containing comma-separated values
Array of strings","An IP address subnet or an array of IP addresses and subnets to trust. Pre-configured subnet names are: 
loopback - 127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128 
linklocal - 169.254.0.0/16 fe80::/10 
uniquelocal - 10.0.0.0/8 172.16.0.0/12 192.168.0.0/16 fc00::/7 Set IP addresses in any of the following ways: Specify a single subnet: app.set(trust proxy loopback) Specify a subnet and an address: app.set(trust proxy loopback 123.123.123.123) Specify multiple subnets as CSV: app.set(trust proxy loopback linklocal uniquelocal) Specify multiple subnets as an array: app.set(trust proxy [loopback linklocal uniquelocal]) When specified the IP addresses or the subnets are excluded from the address determination process and the untrusted IP address nearest to the application server is determined as the client’s IP address."
Number,Trust the nth hop from the front-facing proxy server as the client.
Function,Custom trust implementation. Use this only if you know what you are doing. app.set(trust proxy function (ip) { if (ip === 127.0.0.1 || ip === 123.123.123.123) return true; // trusted IPs else return false; });
Type,Value
Boolean,"true enables weak ETag. This is the default setting.
 false disables ETag altogether."
String,"If ""strong"" enables strong ETag.
 If ""weak"" enables weak ETag."
Function,Custom ETag function implementation. Use this only if you know what you are doing. app.set(etag function (body encoding) { return generateHash(body encoding); // consider the function is defined });
